            <h2>Mobile App Multi Plataform</h2>
            <p>
                the client wanted an app to locate the nearest carshop or autoparts store so the users can get help or know where to get help. The greatest challange was to make a crossplataform app with the same looks and feel for android and IOS within a month.
            </p>
            <p>
                I build the whole solution stack, web api for login and fetch data from the database as well the database used to the stores. I develope app using React Native to speed up the proccess due the time to deliver the app. one of the main problems was to render
                in the map all the markers and update them as the locations change without drain the battery of the user, we have to optimize this groping the map markets in clusters.
            </p>
            <p>
                The color and the UI was simple and intuitive. The client didnÂ´t provide any guide for the design or colors palette so I focus in make the app as simple as posible becuase it was intended to be used in case of something went wrong and you need assistance
                with your car.
            </p>
            <p>
                the app is not realease to the public yet so I cnat upload alot of img or media or disclose more details about it, but I can say I'm glad to have worked in this project becuase It was my first international Mobile project since the company I developed
                this app is from USA.

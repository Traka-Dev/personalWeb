            <h2>Inventory Management Software</h2>
            <p>
                This was my first IT solution for a SME <strong>[Small Med-size Enterprises]</strong> and I have 4 months to develop a solution to connect inventory management with the E Commerce so the website has live inventory data and as orders are
                made we update the stock to automate re-orders for raw materials and make reports about sales and waste so it calculates profit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge was to identify the needs of the client and then make a web app. This is a critical step because in my experience as a consultant, the client does not always understand what they really need so you have to understand the business
                and what the client tells you they need so you can suggest a real solution for their problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case it was something similar. The client wanted a cloud solution but they also wanted to host their servers, but they didn't have any IT department so this was confusing. I explained why it was best to use cloud servers and maybe in the future
                migrate to host their own servers. Since they are a small business the cost of servers and personnel to manage them was really expensive and it went out of budget.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I suggested a Cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud since the first year was almost free of charge and then they could evaluate if they keep it that way or start hiring an IT department, at the end the client went for the cloud service.

            <h2>Business Web - Blog</h2>
            <p>
                This is my business website where I practice SEO so the website has a better ranking in Google Search Results. Nowadays it's really important to have an online presence and thatâ€™s where you have to do SEO and SEM if you want to stand out.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed using Wordpress because if you have a blog it's easier to do SEO since there are a lot of tools to automate most of the task and you focus only on creating content to engage potential buyers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest challenge was to make this site have a serious look with modern design and target the right customer for our service since I wanted to help small businesses who want to get an online presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might be wondering why I need more than one site ? It's because I want to have a strong personal brand but also I want to have a business brand so people know me and know my business and it helps me to land better job offers and projects.
            </p>

                <p>ok I'm not a ninja xD, I'm Jorge Luis Jaime S&aacute;nchez AKA Traka Dev and since I remenber, I was crazy about computers becuase I saw the potencial they have to transform our live, so I started to learn about tech until I found out
                    that I could develope my own tools then everything changed and became a self-taught developer learning PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL and then JAVA to develope android apps and multiplataform tools.<br><br> After I could launch my first static
                    web site, I started to learn about Cybersecurity to protect it and then becuase it was fun, and finally Javascript(frameworks).
                </p>
                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I worked in Accenture for 1 year helping to develope a ERP (Enterprise Resource Plannings) as a Junion analyst, I interview the client to understand the requierements for the software.<br><br> I developed a tool to remove the google
                    account FRP when Google introduced the lock for the first time, I used Java to make it CrossPlataform and a graphic user interface.<br><br> I developed my first Android App called Wifi Unlocker, it was a tool to test the security of
                    your wifi, I collected several algorithms to try to generate the default password for the routers and develope the first app to generate the passwords for Totalplay router's in Mexico, so this app reached almost 500,000 downloads but
                    Google took it down becuase it was a hacking tool. :c<br><br> I developed A React Native App for a client to help the user to find a close by service provider in USA. it was a great challange since I have a month to finish it. The
                    hardest part was to compile the IOS app in a M1 chipset mac. I have to switch to Expo from React Native CLI to be able to compile the app for IOS and due the time left to deliver it was the fastest option and the client aggred to the
                    change to update it later on CLI.<br><br> Last I have deployed tons of personal blogs, eccommerces and enterprise websites using wordpress/woocommerce even a MarketPlace Multivendor Custom Made becuase it's easy to maintain and for
                    most clients it's the best approach, becuase it's fast to develope, design and mantain. The best part of using Wordpress is that if you change from developer or agency it's very easy to keep developing since day one, you dont have
                    to wast tons of hours or even days to understand the project.
